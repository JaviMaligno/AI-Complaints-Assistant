# AI-Assisted Complaints Handling

**Context**

Aftercare handles customer complaints across multiple channels. The current complaints process is slow, expensive, and inconsistent. Leadership believes an AI chatbot could help speed things up.

**Goal**

Design a solution where an AI chatbot helps manage the *initial* complaint intake and, in some cases, resolves the complaint end-to-end without human involvement.

**What we think we want (but aren’t sure):**

* Faster complaint resolution times
* Lower operational cost
* Better customer experience
* Fewer complaints escalated to human agents

**High-level idea**

Customers interact with an AI chatbot that:

* Understands the complaint
* Collects relevant details
* Either resolves the issue directly or passes it to a human agent with context

**Constraints (intentionally incomplete):**

* Must work with Aftercare’s existing systems
* Must not increase regulatory or legal risk
* Must not frustrate customers
* Should “feel human enough”

**Open questions (intentionally unanswered):**

* What counts as a “complaint”?
* When is AI allowed to fully resolve vs escalate?
* What does “success” actually mean?
* What happens when the AI is wrong?
* How do we prevent abuse or hallucinations?

**Your task**

You are not expected to build anything.

Walk us through:

1. What questions you would ask first
2. How you would break this problem down
3. How you’d decide what the AI should and should not do
4. What a first version (v1) would look like
5. How you would measure whether this is working

You may assume AI tools are available to you.
